I will be starting a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan---Ann Arbor in Fall 2026, supervised by Prof. [Inigo Incer](https://iincer.github.io/). Currently, I am an undergraduate double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of category theory and control systems.
