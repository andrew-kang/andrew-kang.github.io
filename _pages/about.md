I will be starting a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, supervised by Prof. [Inigo Incer](https://iincer.github.io/). Currently, I am a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/).
